# Post-hoc Explainable AI for CNNs
This <a href="https://github.com/YousOuad/XAI/blob/main/XAI_for_images.pdf">research project</a> tries to benchmark the methods that explain AI decisions on images classification.

The project was done under the supervision of INRIA in the person of Frédéric Precioso and IBM in the person of Greger Ottoson.


The <a href="https://github.com/YousOuad/XAI/blob/main/XAI_for_images.pdf">paper</a> is self-explanatory, the code for each method was written and executed on Google collab.
